- [flashproxy](https://crypto.stanford.edu/flashproxy/) -  miniature proxy that runs in a web browser, and reflects traffic to a Tor relay.
- [meek](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek) - Tor pluggable transport that uses HTTP for carrying bytes and TLS for obfuscation.
- [scramblesuit](http://www.cs.kau.se/philwint/scramblesuit/) - Tor pluggable transport that uses look-like-nothing traffic as a cover channel
- [FTE](https://github.com/kpdyer/fteproxy) - fteproxy provides transport-layer protection to resist keyword filtering, censorship and discriminatory routing policies
